Welcome to parkswim #234!
Some of you look surprised, so I guess you didn&amp;rsquo;t get the memo. Let me explain. We are expecting floods of biblical proportions this morning, so instead of cancelling the event, we just reclassified it. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how we go.
So, any first-time parkswimmers amongst us? Yes, all of us. Welcome!
What about visitors from other parkswims? Where from? Thanks for joining us!</description>

      <description>Do you ever wake up to the sounds of tiny voices? Do you ever wake up to the sounds of tiny voices, growing louder and louder? Do you ever wake up to the sounds of tiny voices, growing louder and louder into an argument? Do you ever wake up to the sounds of tiny voices, growing louder and louder into an argument and it&amp;rsquo;s not your kids?
Well, I do, especially on Saturdays.</description>

      <description>Good morning again and welcome to Mount Barker parkrun 205!
You know how there are claims that we are the best parkrun in Australia? And then all the Strathalbyn folk start to grumble?
Well, I&amp;rsquo;d like to read you a few Facebook reviews that settle this score once and for all.
Clarence Stroll writes [read from the phone]: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to 39 different parkruns and Mount Barker is by far my favourite.</description>

      <description>Good morning everyone and welcome to Mount Barker parkrun 198! It&amp;rsquo;s a bit chilly this morning, but it warms my heart to see you all come out here. Speaking of which, are there any first timers amongst us today? Welcome and congratulations you are about to have a transformative experience. What about any visitors? Where did you travel from?
There is lots of excitement around this morning. For starters we&amp;rsquo;ll be trialing the parkrun virtual volunteer iPhone app for timing and scanning.</description>

      <description>For parkrun 175 Hugo built an R2D2 look-a-like Lego Mindstorms robot and I programmed it to help deliver the speech. Here is how it went:
Me: [madly pulling out the battery to do a hard reset after the program didn&amp;rsquo;t want to exit from the morning&amp;rsquo;s test run]  Hard rest R2D2   Me: Welcome I found this droid on the way to parkrun and it says it has an urgent message for us.</description>

      <description>Good morning and welcome to parkrun #242.
We don&amp;rsquo;t have any parkrun milestones to celebrate today, so let&amp;rsquo;s give ourselves a big cheer for just turning up.
An interesting thing happened to me yesterday: I received an email from the future. I got sent the Mount Barker parkrun speech for parkrun number 1282 in the year 2038. I thought that you might be interested to hear how things have or have not changed.</description>

      <description>Good morning and welcome! Welcome to parkrun 167!
There was a TV show called Cheers when I was growing up. I was little and didn&amp;rsquo;t get it, but the title song stuck with me. The two lines I remember the most from it are:
Where everybody knows your name And they&amp;rsquo;re always glad you came
These two lines popped into my head recently and I thought this is just like parkrun: I know everyone&amp;rsquo;s name because I process the results and everyone is glad I came because I bring the stopwatch.</description>

      <description>Good morning and welcome to parkrun (what number are we up to?)!
I am feeling a bit lazy this morning, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be a director instead of a runner. So lazy in fact, that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d oursource as many responsibilities as possible.
Please raise your hand if you are a regular parkrunner? Please raise your hand if you are a first timer or a visitor? Welcome! Regular parkrunners, can you please adopt a first timer or a visitor after the speech.</description>

      <description>Good morning and welcome to parkrun 151, which also happens to be the total number of Pokémon in the original set.
It seems to be a bit cold this morning so let&amp;rsquo;s warm up with a bit of clapping.
Rub hands, ok, ready?
Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it for our volunteers Aimee on stopwatch, Jasmin &amp;amp; Andrew on finish tokens, Julie &amp;amp; Rebekah behind the scanner, Jonathan bringing up the rear and Lucy behind the camera.</description>

Good morning and welcome to parkrun 139 or as my 3-year old daughter calls it &amp;ldquo;the party&amp;rdquo;.
I would like to acknowledge that today we&amp;rsquo;ll be running on the land of the Peramagk people.
I would also like to acknowledge all of our volunteers. We have a very experienced crew today. We are in the very safe hands of David on stopwatch, Jordan on finish tokens, the Bracken family Cameron, Andrew and Declan on token scanning and sorting, the cousins Gary and Paul are our photographer and marshal (and welcome back to you both).</description>

Good morning and welcome to Mount Barker parkrun 135. A lucky number with rare mathematical properties and you can read more about it on the pavement over there.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with an apology today. Last time I was in charge I said &amp;ldquo;Run this way until you see a flag near Bald Hills Rd, turn around it and come back&amp;rdquo; and then it turned out that there was no half-way flag; some people never turned around and for all I know may still be running.</description>

Top of the parkrun morning to you friends!
Ah it&amp;rsquo;s so good to be here again. I get so excited about parkrun that I wrote a song about it. Grette is going to help me with it. The song is about a runner who gets lost in a crowd and it goes something like this&amp;hellip;
Before I start are there any first timers today? And what about visitors from another parkrun?</description>

      <description>True story: I went to a work dinner last night. Got employee of the year award. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard. I was the only one who hang around for the whole year. It was so loud there though that I lost my voice talking to people. Then I came back so late I had no time to prepare my speech for this morning. So I thought I just confess up front that I&amp;rsquo;ll be mostly improvising today.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome I have a little story for you this morning.
Once upon a time there was a little boy.
His favourite day of the week was Saturday because he got to get up early and go to parkrun with his neighbour.
The boy loved parkrun. He loved looking at the crowd of friendly faces and listening to the run director&amp;rsquo;s welcome speech.
That day
13 June Queen&amp;rsquo;s Birthday fun run where you run 5km without a watch and whoever gets the closest to their estimated time wins.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the inaugural 2016 parkrun fashion parade. We have a lot of exceptional models lined up for you so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
First up we have Kent who wears his signature smile and a PB of 18:45. He is only the second home grown parkrunner after Errol to hit the 100 mark. Kent has been a parkrun tourist at more venues than I have had hot meals. He is a regular pacer and one of our fastest and most accomplished runners, but this is not his biggest achievement.</description>

If there are any first timers please raise your hand or miss out for you only get one chance to be a first timer.</description>
