      <description>Good morning and welcome! Welcome to parkrun 167!
There was a TV show called Cheers when I was growing up. I was little and didn&amp;rsquo;t get it, but the title song stuck with me. The two lines I remember the most from it are:
Where everybody knows your name And they&amp;rsquo;re always glad you came
These two lines popped into my head recently and I thought this is just like parkrun: I know everyone&amp;rsquo;s name because I process the results and everyone is glad I came because I bring the stopwatch.</description>
