We don&rsquo;t have any parkrun milestones to celebrate today, so let&rsquo;s give ourselves a big cheer for just turning up.
An interesting thing happened to me yesterday: I received an email from the future. I got sent the Mount Barker parkrun speech for parkrun number 1282 in the year 2038. I thought that you might be interested to hear how things have or have not changed.

Welcome to parkswim #234!
Some of you look surprised, so I guess you didn&rsquo;t get the memo. Let me explain. We are expecting floods of biblical proportions this morning, so instead of cancelling the event, we just reclassified it. Let&rsquo;s see how we go.
So, any first-time parkswimmers amongst us? Yes, all of us. Welcome!
What about visitors from other parkswims? Where from? Thanks for joining us!

There is lots of excitement around this morning. For starters we&rsquo;ll be trialing the parkrun virtual volunteer iPhone app for timing and scanning.

There is lots of excitement all around, apart from the crazy weather. This week we have the official Aldinga Beach parkrun launch followed by the Adelaide marathon tomorrow. Next week we have the offical Port Lincoln parkrun launch followed by the Kangaroo Island marathon.
Anyone doing any of these events?
So, do we have any first timers? What about visitors? Well,keep up with the river until you see the flag near Bald Hills Rd, then turn around and come back.

      Good morning and welcome! Welcome to parkrun 167!
There was a TV show called Cheers when I was growing up. I was little and didn&rsquo;t get it, but the title song stuck with me. The two lines I remember the most from it are:
Where everybody knows your name And they&rsquo;re always glad you came
These two lines popped into my head recently and I thought this is just like parkrun: I know everyone&rsquo;s name because I process the results and everyone is glad I came because I bring the stopwatch.

I would like to acknowledge that today we&rsquo;ll be running on the land of the Peramagk people.

We are in the very safe hands of David on stopwatch, Jordan on finish tokens, the Bracken family Cameron, Andrew and Declan on token scanning and sorting, the cousins Gary and Paul are our photographer and marshal (and welcome back to you both).

Good morning and welcome to Mount Barker parkrun 135. A lucky number with rare mathematical properties and you can read more about it on the pavement over there.
I&rsquo;d like to start with an apology today. Last time I was in charge I said &ldquo;Run this way until you see a flag near Bald Hills Rd, turn around it and come back&rdquo; and then it turned out that there was no half-way flag; some people never turned around and for all I know may still be running.

      Good morning and welcome to Mount Barker parkrun CXXX, which is the Roman numeral for 130.
Are there any first timers? Welcome. What about visitors? Where are you from? Run this way until you see a flag near Bald Hills Rd, turn around it and come back.
Quick quiz: what do you get when you mix the Indian spring festival of Color Holi with a 5km race and charity fundraiser. The answer is the Color run.

Top of the parkrun morning to you friends!
Ah it&rsquo;s so good to be here again. I get so excited about parkrun that I wrote a song about it. Grette is going to help me with it. The song is about a runner who gets lost in a crowd and it goes something like this&hellip;
Before I start are there any first timers today? And what about visitors from another parkrun?

Today is election day. Today you choose between progress and stagnation. Today you choose between weak and strong. Today you choose between health and sickness. Today you vote with your feet. I&rsquo;d like to congratulate you all for choosing progress, strength and health by being here with us this morning.
Are there any first time voters? How about visiting voters?
Today we celebrate 100 parkruns for one of our regular voters.

      True story: I went to a work dinner last night. Got employee of the year award. That wasn&rsquo;t hard. I was the only one who hang around for the whole year. It was so loud there though that I lost my voice talking to people. Then I came back so late I had no time to prepare my speech for this morning. So I thought I just confess up front that I&rsquo;ll be mostly improvising today.

      Hi, welcome I have a little story for you this morning.
Once upon a time there was a little boy.
His favourite day of the week was Saturday because he got to get up early and go to parkrun with his neighbour.
The boy loved parkrun. He loved looking at the crowd of friendly faces and listening to the run director&rsquo;s welcome speech.
That day
13 June Queen&rsquo;s Birthday fun run where you run 5km without a watch and whoever gets the closest to their estimated time wins.

      Welcome to the inaugural 2016 parkrun fashion parade. We have a lot of exceptional models lined up for you so let&rsquo;s get started.
First up we have Kent who wears his signature smile and a PB of 18:45. He is only the second home grown parkrunner after Errol to hit the 100 mark. Kent has been a parkrun tourist at more venues than I have had hot meals. He is a regular pacer and one of our fastest and most accomplished runners, but this is not his biggest achievement.

      Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to run our Saturday parkrun. Not to be entered into lightly, parkrun should be entered into solemnly and with reverence and honour, a proper warmup and half-decent footwear. Into this holy agreement we come together to get healthier and stronger so we may serve others.
If there are any first timers please raise your hand or miss out for you only get one chance to be a first timer.
